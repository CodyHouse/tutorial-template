# How to

The SCSS of the tutorial is in the main > assets > css > _tutorial.scss file.

The JavaScript of the tutorial is in the main > assets > js > tutorial.js file.

In the style.scss file, we import [CodyFrame](https://codyhouse.co/ds/docs/framework) (CodyHouse front-end framework) basic style as npm module and _custom-style.scss, where we define the global style of buttons, forms, typography and more.

## Gulp
To make changes to this project, you can use the Gulp configuration file included in the source files. Once you have downloaded the source files, navigate to the tutorial folder, and run the following commands in your command line:

```
npm install
npm run gulp watch
```

The first command will install the modules required for compiling SCSS into CSS and importing CodyFrame; the second will launch your project on a development server.

⚠️ **Note:** if you receive error messages while trying to run the `npm install` command, you may need to download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com) first.
